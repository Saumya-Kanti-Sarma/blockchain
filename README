# Blockchain Network for Government Transparency

A blockchain-based system designed to enhance transparency and accountability in government records by tracking financial allocations, including:

- **Who** receives funds
- **From whom** funds are allocated
- **When** transactions occur

## Network Architecture

The system operates as a distributed network where multiple stakeholders maintain nodes:

- Government agencies
- Opposition parties
- Other relevant departments

This decentralized approach ensures system integrity and prevents single points of failure.
