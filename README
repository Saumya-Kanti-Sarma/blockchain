what I am building?
my head is full of abstracts. I clearly dont understand blockchain or bitcoins at all rn but I'm trying to make a digital currency that mimics gold base currency. Why we trust banks at this moment? because bank ensures that our paper money is worth of gold. i.e if we give ₹1000 to bank then they enssure to give us gold worth of the same ammout. and why is gold valuable? because it's pretty, hard to mine and is not available in abundance. So to make a digital currency I must fullfil all those criterias:
    1. It must be pretty.
    2. It must be hard to get.
    3. It must be not available in abundance.
what a block must have?
Assuming that I am building some kind of transaction record a block must have 

{
  sender_addr,
  reciever_addr,
  amount_transfer,
  sender's_balance,
  time_stamp,

}
